# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
Objective
The objective of this project is to build a logistic regression model to predict the risk of heart disease in patients based on the Framingham Heart Study dataset.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Framingham Heart Study dataset, which contains over 4,000 records and includes 15 cardiovascular risk factors. The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link: Heart Disease Prediction Dataset.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. Kaggle : The main script for this project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It includes the following sections:

Importing Libraries
